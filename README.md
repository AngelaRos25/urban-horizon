## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.


## Getting Started 
### Installation: 
1. Clone repository:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Giangy25/urban-horizon
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory and open in VSCode:
   
   ```bash
   cd repository-name
   code 
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start development server:
   
   ```bash
   npm serve
   ```
  Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

To generate a new component, run: `ng generate component component-name`.

To generate a different type of file, you can also use: `ng generate directives|pipe|service|class|guard|module|interface`.

### Build

To buid the project, run: `ng build`.
This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the dist/ directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.
